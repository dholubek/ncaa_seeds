# 2017 was the first year Florida, Florida State, and Miami all made the men's NCAA tournament

as cited here:

but four Florida teaams made the tournament including Florida Gulf Coast.  So is that the full story?  Have there been other years where three or more Florida teams made the tournament?  If so when were they?  Which Florida teams have the most appearances to the tournament?
